Given a non empty array of positive inegers representing the amount of time it take the query to execute.
A query's waiting time is defines as amount of time it waits before execution.
Write a fn. that returns minimum waiting time for all the queries

T:o(nlogn), s:o(1)

int minimumWaitingTime(vector<int> queries) {
  // Write your code here.
  // sort query so that minimum time query is executed first, so that remaining queries have to wait lesser.
	sort(queries.begin(), queries.end());
	int total = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
    // for each query, the remiang query has to wait till the current query is executed, so multiply remaining queries with execution time of current query.
		int qleft = queries.size() - i - 1;
		total += queries[i] * qleft;
	}
  return total;
}
